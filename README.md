# Exploring SARS‐CoV‐2 Antibody Data through Machine Learning Methods

This repository contains the full codebase for the MSc dissertation:
**"Exploring SARS‐CoV‐2 Antibody Data through Machine Learning Methods"**
by Francesca Chircop (Student ID: 475500L).

## Overview

This project investigates the use of machine learning techniques to analyze and predict antibody-antigen interactions, with a focus on SARS-CoV-2. The repository includes code for data preprocessing, redundancy removal, clustering, predictive model development, and graphical user interface tools.

## Repository Structure

- **Clustering/**
  - Scripts for clustering antibody-antigen sequence pairs.

- **Dataset_Clustering/**
  - Full dataset used for clustering.

- **Dataset_PredictionModels/**
  - Full dataset used for prediction models.

- **Helpers/**
  - Utility scripts and helper functions used by the main analysis pipelines.

- **PredictionModels/**
  - Implementation and evaluation of machine learning models for predicting SARS-CoV-2 antibody-antigen interactions.

- **Tools (GUIs)/**
  - Graphical user interfaces for data exploration and visualization.
